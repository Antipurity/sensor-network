"""
Pretraining for all possible goals is like learning a map of how to get from anywhere to anywhere. Here, we gradually build up to the full formulation in an easily-comprehensible and easily-visualizable environment.

We have a square board here, and 1 agent that can only walk it. If we can't learn a map here, then how can we expect to learn a map in more complex environments?

NO RL machinery! Lessons must be transferrable all the way.

# TODO: Okay, what do we want to learn, building up to URL gradually?
#   - ✓ From board and action (randomly-generated) to board — EASY
#   - ✓ From board and neighboring-board (gotten via env_step with a random action) to action (the randomly-generated one) — will be so easy that it's pointless to implement.
#   - From board & target-board & extra-state & whole-output (or a random vector initially), to the next action & extra state: `next`.
#     - (Need to limit the unroll-length, or else practically everything will count as reachable.)
#     - Average-plan makes no sense because everything is connected to everything, so we need to learn the *distribution* of plans that will lead us to the target, so either:
#       - ⋯ DDPM-like but speedy (not about to do thousands of steps per RNN step): make `next` self-denoising (accept its output as an input, initially a random vector), and wherever we have a loss (here, just: make less-denoised outputs predict more-denoised outputs, only in trajectories that reached the target), make predict-branches have less denoisings than stopgrad-branches to make denoising learned. Possibly, have completely separate RNN-states for different denoising levels. (Sounds quite trainable, but might just collapse diversity like in the initial experiments; maybe using CCL for prediction could help.)
#       - ⋯ GAN-like: train a discriminator (from board & target-board & extra-state & 'whole-output'-randomness) of whether a trajectory will succeed (known after a whole rollout), and maximize the predicted success-probability by all `next`-steps (but not by the discriminator).
#   - Almost-URL: learn the distribution of targets, along with distributions of plans to reach them (learning eventual-RNN-states would have been full URL).
#   - Full URL, where goal-of-state is learned too: goal:ev(state);  goal=ev(next(state, goal))
