Losses like L2 (`(A - B).square().sum()`) or cross-entropy (`(A * B.log()).sum()`) are nice and all.

But even solved problems are never solved. [Evidence that some losses could be better is starting to accumulate.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.03230)

    `CrossCorrelationLoss(axis = -1, decorrelation_strength = 1., prediction = 'l2', shuffle_invariant = False)(x, y)`

    By default, basically `(x.norm(-2) @ y.norm(-2).t() / x.shape[-2] - eye(x.shape[-2])).square().mean(-2).sum()`.

    A differentiable dissimilarity metric that makes [normalized cross-](https://github.com/rogerberm/pytorch-ncc)[correlation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-correlation) (or pairwise [cosine similarity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosine_similarity) if done on matrices) as close to the identity matrix as posssible when minimized (`.backward()`).

    Why: non-pairwise losses can't enforce the lack of redundancy, which makes predicting your own output just turn it into a constant. But this loss does enforce that, [making it usable for self-distillation.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.03230)

    If printing the loss, be advised, it is frequently almost-stuck at `.9786` or similar, but learning still happens.

    Parameters:
    - `axis = -1`: the dimension to compute similarity over. Inputs are put through `x â†’ x.transpose(axis, -2)` before the matrix-multiplication.
    - `decorrelation_strength = .1`: the loss target is separated into `1`s and `0`s, and the loss to `0`s is multiplied by this. The closer to `0`, the more important actual prediction is.
    - `prediction = 'l2'`: [either `'l1'` or `'l2'`.](https://machine-learning-note.readthedocs.io/en/latest/basic/loss_functions.html)
    - `shuffle_invariant = False`: if `True`, the target identity matrix (cross-correlation of a sequence with itself) is replaced with its closest shuffle. Useful if the inputs were computed by a Transformer.

    Notes:
    - `decorrelation_strength > 0` and `prediction = 'l1'`: learning hardly happens, because gradients self-interfere too much.
    - Performs best when both `x` and `y` are differentiable.
    - The more data, the better it learns (L2 loss of normalized vectors can get lower).
    - Optimizing with Adam seems to perform much better than with SGD or RMSprop.
