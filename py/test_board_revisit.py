"""
Here, we revisit the 2D board env, since continuous-control failed.

Open-ended algorithms, to prepare for any goal, learn min-distance paths between *all* source and goal states. In theory, we've *seen* where we've been, so it should be trivial to revisit them, right? In practice, we haven't been able to break away from learning dist-sums, so far, which is probably non-scalable to real-world environments, because it needs to learn quadratically-many numbers — not to mention, not very biologically plausible due to magnitude & precision.

This time:

- To remove prediction-interference: the env's action needs 4 numbers, and is decided by which is higher.

- For grounding, remembered to ensure that `act(prev, goal=next) = action` for all transitions, by setting distance to 0 in these cases.

- Self-imitation now *gates* by old-distance-is-better, doesn't multiply by the distance-differential.

- Now have tree-backup (basically multi-step returns so that dist-sum bootstrapping has more accurate targets), which does improve dist-learning speed, though due to implementation details, .

Unimplemented:

- Classical pathfinding but for ML: Dijkstra-algo-like horizons of tasks that are neither too easy (visited & settled) nor too hard (never neighboring any visited state), like in AMIGo or POET or [iterative deepening](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterative_deepening_depth-first_search). Goals are just randomly selected.
    - (For state-visiting, apply "neighbor's goal can be our own goal too" via an src→goal GAN and an (src,goal)→action net: could initialize the GAN to always output the state as the goal, and to update, make the neighbor generate its goal-suggestion, and make the original-state discriminator judge that as real and make `act` with the generated goal predict the action that's in the picked replay-buffer step; like a GAN, its own generated goals should be judged as fake (*possibly* only if the action-learning loss is sufficiently low). Doesn't even learn the distance, instead just tries to crystallize closest-actions first.)
        - (…Actually sounds unexpectedly simple and plausible…)
        - (…Possibly, to revisit less, learn another GAN of what we've generated, and only allow a goal-suggestion if it's judged as secondhand-fake. Or even reuse the original GAN's discriminator to gate suggestions, but with a momentum-delayed copy.)
        - (…Possibly, use not only goal-of-neighbor with a replayed action (which doesn't have to play nice with our goals), but also goal-of-goal with the same action (which kinda increases our reach, exponentially quickly in fact).)
        - TODO: …Try it then, in this board env?
            - TODO: What are the impl details of our first potentially-plausible algorithm here?
                - TODO: At least map the goal-states through a neural net, right? (So that GANs can feasibly output them.)
                - TODO: . . .
            - …Or should we think about joint embeddings more…

- Contraction hierarchies but for ML: unknown joint-embedding schemes, with which we might be able to *not* learn the distance. Ideally, would learn contraction hierarchies, but *how* is unknown.
    - We need to either try to come up with some, or revisit continuous-control with task-horizons.
    - (Isn't the "dst's dst is our dst too" idea related to node contraction's "remove a graph node and join the path; at query-time, only go up the query-hierarchy (probably measuring embedding similarity)"?)
    - (Joint-embedding is probably the only real option to scale up to realistic environments, because the neural nets will no longer have to learn every single quadratically-numerous dist & action, and very slowly update them when they discover unexpected paths; many implicit datapoints can be updated at once if we use joint-embedding.)

        #     - (But compared to any of the options below, it's amazing.)
        #   - Learn a goal-dependent embedding `ev` for which `ev(prev,g) = prev_ev(ev(next,g))` and `ev(g,g) = OK` (make it smoothly transform into goals), and compare func-call-depths when needed:
        #     - Learn the actual distance given `ev`.
        #     - Learn a comparator of 2 `ev`s, `cmp(fut1, fut2)→-1…0…1`: `cmp(RNN(f),f)=-1`, `cmp(f,f)=0`, `cmp(f,RNN(f))=1`, `cmp(RNN(f), RNN(g)) = cmp(f,g)`, `cmp(RNN(f),g) where cmp(f,g)<0 = -1`, `cmp(f,RNN(g)) where cmp(f,g)>0 = 1`.
        #     - (…Though, learning a goal-dependent vortex is as info-heavy as learning all pairwise distances if not more, so it's just as bad as that.)
        #   - Continuous contraction: given src & dst & max-dist, alter src within those confines to get closer to dst. Then, we can decompose all problems at unroll-time: go halfway, then the rest of the way.
        #     - Have a GAN `alter(src, dst, max_dist)→src` & `alter_dist`, where the 'discriminator' is the distance from output to dst. Losses:
        #       - `alter_dist(prev, next, |prev-next| or more) = |prev-next|`
        #       - `alter_dist(prev, goal, max_dist) = min(max_dist, |prev-next| + .99 * alter_dist(next, goal, dist - |prev-next|))`
        #       - (…Wow, this is even worse than all-to-all distance learning.)
        #   - Discrete contraction hierarchies: ground *tasks* in one-step transitions, and combine 2 consecutive *tasks* on each new hierarchy level (contracting a node by combining 2 actions that go through it in 1 meta-action/shortcut: similar to classical contraction hierarchies). Effectively, the level (an extra input to many neural nets) is floor of log-2 of dist.
        #     - Good: the 'distance' has much less precision and thus takes less space in neural nets. Bad: with N levels, we need N× more compute.
        #     - To always pick the shortest action on each level (especially when we have `A→B  B→C  A→C`) instead of smudging (and trying to connect all to all), we need to learn a "which level does this action come from" net, and use that for gated action-prediction. Which is pretty much the old dist.
        #     - Nodes are learned with BYOL (`next(ev(A)) = sg ev(B)` if A→B is a real meta/transition) to be differentiable, and to make same-endpoints paths have the same embeddings, but if we want this to not collapse or smudge, then we need every single meta-action with distinct endpoints to be both distinct and perfectly-learned. Since there are as many total meta-actions as there are node pairs, we're back to the non-scalable "need quadratic neural-net capacity" but in a worse way.
        #       - (…Wow, this is even worse than all-to-all distance learning. But aren't at least some of its ideas salvageable?)


        # TODO: Our scalability here is atrocious. Be able to scale to the real world: make the goal of our goal *our* goal, AKA compute the transitive closure via embeddings, but only on first visits (otherwise everything will end up connected to everything).
        # …Ideally, we'd like to solve all most-trivial tasks, then do nothing but *combine* the tasks — which should give us the exponential-improvement that dist-learning RL is too bogged-down by quadratic-info to have…
        #   (But we still can't come up with a good way to combine tasks.)



        # What's the best that we can make filling?
        #   Like always with filling, we need a way to distinguish, per-goal (per-task), which sources can reach that spot; or, per-src (per-task), which goals it can reach.
        #   (For each src/dst, we'd like to partition the dst/src space into actions that *first* lead to it, which implies linear capacity (nodes×actions) despite the nodes×nodes input space, not the quadratic capacity of dist-learning (nodes×nodes×actions).)
        #   (…DDPG's trick of "take the min of 2 nets" is really quite clever, since ReLU-nets are piecewise linear functions, so in non-trained regions, the linear pieces would be getting further and further away from data. Usable for GANs, and for synth grad (least-magnitude). Should we use it somewhere?)

        #       TODO: How to weigh `dst`'s discriminator-preference by loss, if we're already specializing to distance and non-middle-ness?
        #   TODO: Also the `src(dst, dist)→src` GAN: exactly the same as src→dst but reversed.
        #     (May be a good idea to fill from both ends, since volumes of hyperspheres in D dims grow by `K**D` times when radii increase by `K` times. Especially good for RL, which is very interested in goal states but may want to explore starting states initially.)
