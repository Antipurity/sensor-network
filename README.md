## Sensor network

Tools for connecting humans and AI models to arbitrary sensors: differentiable [subscribe/publish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publish%E2%80%93subscribe_pattern).

It can represent streams of [any](https://github.com/Antipurity/sensor-network/tree/master/docs/universal-environments.md) named observations and actions.

## Design constraints

- Position-invariance, of cells into which data is divided. This enables hotswappable and user-defined observations/actions, which is how humans [expect ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_(computing))[computers ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB)[to operate ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things)[anyway.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet) In ML, [Transformers are currently dominant anyway.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762)
- -1â€¦1 values, optionally, [mostly for humans.](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/65o0gi/how_loud_is_a_nuclear_explosion_all_noise_is/)
- That's all. A human can use it. AGI can use it.

## You should [eventually](https://github.com/Antipurity/sensor-network/tree/master/docs/ROADMAP.md) be able to:

- Trust in this implementation's production-ready robustness and efficiency.
- Integrate with any OS-level and device-level data.
- Integrate with any machine learning framework and dataset, and allow distilling any ML model. Reachable performance should not deteriorate very significantly compared to non-named representations, either time or objective.
- Equalize capabilities of humans and machines:
    - Enhance machines, by making data about human activity available, and re-using models as much as possible, thus driving the friction and fundamental differences to zero.
