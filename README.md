## Sensor network

Tools for connecting humans and AI models to arbitrary sensors: differentiable [subscribe/publish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publish%E2%80%93subscribe_pattern).

It can represent streams of [any](https://github.com/Antipurity/sensor-network/tree/master/docs/universal-environments.md) named observations and actions.

## Design constraints

- Position-invariance, of cells into which data is divided. This enables hotswappable and user-defined observations/actions, which is how humans [expect ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_(computing))[computers ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB)[to operate ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things)[anyway.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet) In ML, [Transformers are currently dominant anyway.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762)
- -1â€¦1 values, optionally, [mostly for humans.](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/65o0gi/how_loud_is_a_nuclear_explosion_all_noise_is/)
- That's all. A human can use it. AGI can use it.

## You can:

- Collect the [re](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.06701)[q](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.00409)[ui](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.08361)[re](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.10621)[d](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.14701) data for machine learning. [From a web page.](https://github.com/Antipurity/sensor-network/tree/master/js-lib)
- [Mix-and-match multimodal tasks of variable size](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09017), [with 0 or more objectives](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.15422).
- [Not worry about efficiency.](https://Antipurity.github.io/sensor-network)
- TODO: Fully (& a link to privacy considerations: real-time interaction data is the most precious data that can reasonably be collected about you, so to protect it from interests that are contrary to yours (& links to ads, greed, politics?? Or https://www.singularityweblog.com/technology-reveals/), we better make damn sure that we get this right. For humans, having sovereignty over your own body is [a right](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodily_integrity) so fundamental that it's not worth mentioning; we should treat sensor networks with the same standards, and have at least one open-source implementation that is as good as proprietary alternatives.   This sensor-network implementation allows local processing of all data, and encrypted (& what, a link to WebRTC spec?) Internet communication if needed; it does not [depend on exploitation of user data for it to exist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Tech).) control (& a link to the test page) your computer interaction data (& a link to a file like "Humans control bodies, and live for decades. In contrast, computer programs typically have constrained interfaces, and are destroyed when they outlive their use. With a sensor network for a computer program, equality can be achieved. Though for the privileged 'human' class, gains in equality can be [seen as a personal attack](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/big-data-privacy-is-a-bigger-issue-than-you-think/); please don't go overboard with privacy, and don't confuse "scarily accurate" with "out to get you" without non-emotional reasons, [which there often are](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/privacy-concerns-rise-as-businesses-report-increased-personal-data-collection-301356043.html). TODO: And do we go toward personal sensor networks and how compute growth could make them viable within our lifetimes?"): collect it (& a link to sensors), store it (& a link to the database), extend it over the Internet (& a link to the Internet handler)
- TODO: Maybe, "easily design your own data collection pipeline, and/or integrate arbitrary pipelines in one AI model at the same time"? What would we link to? The test page?
- TODO: What about funky sounds? It definitely needs to be said somewhere to give a solid grounding of what a human's preferred interface is like; but where and how?

## You should [eventually](https://github.com/Antipurity/sensor-network/tree/master/docs/ROADMAP.md) be able to:

- Trust in this implementation's production-ready robustness and efficiency.
- Integrate with any OS-level and device-level data.
- Integrate with any machine learning framework and dataset, and allow distilling any ML model. Reachable performance should not deteriorate very significantly compared to non-named representations, either time or objective.
- Equalize capabilities of humans and machines:
    - Enhance machines, by making data about human activity available, driving the friction and fundamental differences to zero.

        - More concretely, transform real-time data into a relevant (TODO: RL; and maybe dataset summarization; and maybe "learning to summarize from human feedback", though it's not like we're translating to a human language) compressed (TODO: SSL) summary, and [translate](https://github.com/Antipurity/sensor-network/tree/master/docs/human-sense-constraints.md) limited human actions (TODO: prediction & quantilizers) into any [machine-accessible](https://github.com/Antipurity/sensor-network/tree/master/docs/universal-environments.md) actions. And propagate the precedent of some human-AI symbiosis (TODO: Maybe, link to some "science is a collective endeavor"?...).
- TODO: What about uniting AI models, letting them learn from data and each other (AI as the infinite conceptual rainbow)? Can we relate this to a useful thing? Link to nearest-neighbor search, maybe?
    - TODO: ...Would this perform any better than incorporating a differentiable model directly into your own, through newly-learned interfaces, though?
- TODO: Above, WHERE ARE THE LINKS THAT JUSTIFY THE NEED FOR EACH AND EVERY ONE OF THEM
- TODO: What other AI capabilities did we want, exactly?
- Take control of an enemy spaceship in seconds like it's sci-fi. Once spaceships are invented.

Does this sensor network have to visibly implement AGI and the singularity before you care about its refined generality? It has essentially no design constraints, so, [eventua](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Singularity_Is_Near)[lly](https://www.academia.edu/36810724/The_21st_Century_Singularity_and_its_Big_History_Implications_A_re_analysis)?
